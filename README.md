# Bayesian Inference

This repository contains coursework and exercises from my Bayesian Inference class. It includes assignments, quizzes, group work, and major exams (mid-semester and end-semester). All analysis and computations are performed in **R**.

## Objectives

- Understand the foundational principles of Bayesian statistics.
- Apply Bayesian methods to real and simulated data.
- Perform Bayesian estimation and inference using R.
- Interpret posterior distributions and credibility intervals.
- Explore decision-making under uncertainty using Bayesian reasoning.

---

## Tools & Packages

- **R**  
- Key packages: `rstan`, `bayesplot`, `coda`, `brms`, `ggplot2` and many others
