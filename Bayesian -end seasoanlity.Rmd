## Case Study 11: Bayesian Estimation in Environmental Monitoring (Air Pollution Levels)

Narrative A metropolitan area is engaged in continuous environmental monitoring to track air quality. Daily measurements of particulate matter are modeled as normally distributed, but the mean and variance may vary due to seasonal effects and local conditions. Policy makers need robust estimates to trigger public health warnings and environmental interventions.

Bayesian Model

Prior Distribution: A conjugate Normal-Inverse-Gamma prior is used: 𝜇 ∣ 𝜎2 ∼𝒩(𝜇0,𝜎2/𝜅0), 𝜎2 ∼ Inverse-Gamma(𝛼0,𝛽0)

Hyperparameters are chosen based on historical air quality data.

Likelihood Function: For daily pollutant levels 𝑌𝑖: 𝑌𝑖 ∣ 𝜇,𝜎2 ∼ 𝒩(𝜇,𝜎2)

## QUESTIION 1

### Use Gibbs sampling to obtain the joint posterior for 𝜇 and 𝜎2.

The posterior mean,24.63301,represents the expected mean of the air quality (particulate matter) across all days, after accounting for the seasonal effects and prior assumptions. The 95% credible interval (CI) is [18.50975, 31.07808], meaning there is a 95% probability that the true mean falls in this range.

The posterior variance,15.8266,represents the estimate of the variability or spread of the air quality data across the year.The 95% CI for variance is [13.70233, 18.28859], indicating the uncertainty in the spread of pollution measurements.

Trace plot for mean:
- The plot shows sampled values fluctuating around a central value (e.g., ~22–26).The lack of extreme jumps suggests stable sampling.

Trace plot for variance:
- Similar to μ, the values fluctuate around a central point (e.g., ~14–18).No long-term trends indicate convergence

This first diagram consists of two separate density plots, showing the marginal posteriors of μ (left) and σ2 (right)

Left Plot: Posterior of μ - This density plot (in blue) represents the posterior distribution of the mean (μ). -The peak is around 24--25, suggesting that the most probable value for the mean air quality (PM2.5) level is approximately 24.6. - The distribution appears approximately normal, which aligns with Bayesian updating given the conjugate prior structure.

Right Plot: Posterior of σ 2 - This density plot (in red) represents the posterior distribution of variance (σ 2). - The peak occurs around 15--16, indicating that the most probable variance of air quality measurements is approximately 15.8. - The distribution is right-skewed, which is expected for an Inverse-Gamma posterior.

Instead of drawing exact samples, the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm proposes new parameter values and accepts or rejects them based on their posterior probability.

The posterior mean (μ) of 25.09728 represents the expected mean of the air quality (particulate matter) across all days, after accounting for the seasonal effects and prior assumptions. The 95% credible interval (CI) is [19.50193, 30.51919], meaning there is a 95% probability that the true mean falls within this range.

The posterior variance (σ²) of 15.76038 represents the estimate of the variability or spread of the air quality data across the year. The 95% CI for variance is [13.59699, 18.2487], indicating the uncertainty in the spread of pollution measurements.

The acceptance rate is 0.2526, meaning about 25.26% of the proposed parameter updates were accepted during the Metropolis-Hastings sampling. This is a good acceptance rate. In Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, an acceptance rate of around 23% to 50% is generally considered optimal for efficient exploration of the parameter space. Therefore, this acceptance rate suggests the algorithm is effectively exploring the parameter space while maintaining an efficient sampling process.

Comparison of Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Sampling\
Key Observations and Insights:

1.  Posterior Mean (μ)
    -   The posterior mean of μ from MH (25.271) closely matches the estimate from Gibbs sampling (24.633) with a difference of \~0.64.
    -   The credible intervals largely overlap. The MH interval is slightly narrower, likely due to the joint proposal strategy or efficient tuning of the proposal distributions.
2.  Posterior Variance (σ²)
    -   The posterior mean of σ² from MH (15.749) is also similar to that from Gibbs (15.827).
    -   The credible intervals are almost the same, indicating strong agreement between the two methods.
3.  Seasonal Effects
    -   Both methods agree on the sign of seasonal effects (e.g., Season 2 is negative in both).\
    -   MH tends to produce slightly more conservative (closer to zero) estimates for seasonal effects.\
    -   The credible intervals overlap significantly, though Gibbs intervals are wider for some seasons (e.g., Season 1 and 4), suggesting slightly higher uncertainty in Gibbs sampling for these effects.

Conclusion\
Since both Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings produce highly similar estimates for the mean (μ), variance (σ²), and seasonal effects---with overlapping credible intervals---this confirms that:\
- The Bayesian model is well-specified.\
- The posterior distribution is being sampled correctly.\
- The results are robust to the choice of sampling method.

This comparison confirms that both methods are valid for air pollution monitoring, with Gibbs being slightly more efficient for this particular model structure. The close agreement strengthens confidence in the results for policy decisions.

Trace Plot for μ
- More pronounced fluctuations than Gibbs, with occasional jumps (e.g., spikes/drops).Overall stability suggests convergence after burn-in.

Trace Plot for σ²
- Similar to μ, but with less extreme variation. Values stabilize around ~14–16 after burn-in.

```

The following are the key observation form all three graphs :-

Left Panel: Posterior of μ(blue) - The shape is multi-modal (multiple peaks) → this suggests there are possibly seasonality effects that make some values more likely than others. -The range is approximately from 18 to 32. - The highest density (most probable μ values) is around 24--26.

Right Panel: Posterior of σ² - This distribution is unimodal (one peak), and nicely bell-shaped, indicating high certainty about the value. - The most likely values lie between 13 and 17, with a peak near 15.

```

Winter (Blue): Generally exhibits higher PM2.5 levels, likely due to factors like increased heating, lower atmospheric dispersion, and potential temperature inversions.

Spring (Green): Shows a slight decrease in PM2.5 levels, possibly due to better air circulation and reduced emissions from heating sources.

Summer (Red): Has higher variability, with some peak pollution events. High temperatures may contribute to secondary pollutant formation.

Fall (Orange): Appears to show moderate pollution levels, transitioning from summer to winter.

```{r}
# Calculate posterior predictive distribution statistics
posterior_predictive_mean <- mean(future_predictions)
posterior_predictive_var <- var(future_predictions)

# Print results
cat("Posterior Predictive Mean (with seasonality):", round(posterior_predictive_mean, 2), "μg/m³\n")
cat("Posterior Predictive Variance (with seasonality):", round(posterior_predictive_var, 2), "\n")

# Calculate seasonal posterior predictive statistics
seasonal_pp_means <- tapply(future_predictions, future_season, mean)
seasonal_pp_vars <- tapply(future_predictions, future_season, var)

cat("Seasonal Posterior Predictive Means:\n")
print(round(seasonal_pp_means, 2))
cat("\nSeasonal Posterior Predictive Variances:\n")
print(round(seasonal_pp_vars, 2))
```

This code calculates the posterior predictive distribution statistics for future PM2.5 concentrations, taking seasonality into account.

Winter (1) has the highest mean PM2.5 (26.31 μg/m³), indicating worse air quality.Winter's high PM2.5 levels support stricter emissions regulations, particularly for heating sources.

Spring (2) and Fall (4) have lower means, suggesting relatively cleaner air.Spring and Fall improvements suggest possible natural dispersion benefits, which could inform seasonal restrictions on industrial activities

Summer (3) has a higher variance (30.96), indicating more fluctuations in pollution levels.Summer's high variance implies unpredictable pollution spikes, possibly due to secondary pollutant formation from heat and photochemical reactions.

```{r}
# Plot Posterior Predictive Distribution
plot(density(as.vector(future_predictions)), col = "purple", lwd = 2,

```

The plot you provided represents the Posterior Predictive Distribution of Future PM2.5 Concentration based on Bayesian inference.

The smooth curve represents the probability distribution of PM2.5 concentration based on the posterior samples.

The peak of the curve indicates the most likely predicted PM2.5 concentration.

The slightly right-skewed shape suggests that while most predictions fall within a central range, higher PM2.5 concentrations are possible but less likely.

The density peak (\~20-30 µg/m³) suggests that most future predictions cluster around this range.

The tail extending beyond 40 µg/m³ indicates the possibility of extreme pollution events, though they are rare.

There is a 38.3% chance that future PM2.5 concentrations will exceed 25 µg/m³.

Winter: 54.9% chance PM2.5 \> 25 µg/m³ (Highest risk)

Summer: 47.8% chance PM2.5 \> 25 µg/m³

Fall: 26.4% chance PM2.5 \> 25 µg/m³

Spring: 23.9% chance PM2.5 \> 25 µg/m³ (Lowest risk)

Winter has the highest exceedance probability (54.9%), suggesting pollution is worst during colder months, possibly due to increased emissions from heating and stagnant air conditions.

Spring (23.9%) and Fall (26.4%) have lower risks, likely due to better atmospheric dispersion.

Summer still has a high exceedance probability (47.8%), possibly due to wildfires, ozone interactions, or industrial activity.

The model evaluates the probability of air quality exceeding a set threshold (T = 25) for each season and applies a Bayesian decision rule.

-   For Winter Analysis (54.9% exceedance probability) Decision Threshold: 60/800=0.075 Decision: Since the exceedance probability (54.9%) is much higher than the threshold (7.5%), strong interventions are activated

-   For Spring Analysis (23.9% exceedance probability) Decision Threshold: 50/500=0.1 Decision: Since the exceedance probability (23.9%) is above the threshold (10%), targeted measures are implemented.

-   For Summer Analysis (47.8% exceedance probability) Decision Threshold: 55/600=0.092 Decision: Since the exceedance probability (47.8%) is much higher than the threshold (9.2%), strong interventions are activated.

-   For Fall Analysis (26.4% exceedance probability) Decision Threshold: 50/550=0.091 Decision: Since the exceedance probability (26.4%) is much higher than the threshold (9.1%), strong interventions are activated.

-   The overall False Alarm Cost (C_F) and Miss Cost (C_M) are averaged across seasons: Overall Decision Threshold = 53.75/612.5=0.088 Since the exceedance probability (38.25%) is higher than the overall decision threshold (0.088), the system issues a "Regional Crisis: Coordinated Emergency Response".

Winter and Summer require stronger interventions due to high exceedance probabilities.

Spring and Fall require targeted measures, but still demand attention.

The overall exceedance probability (38.25%) is concerning, triggering a regional emergency response.

Decision thresholds are computed dynamically based on season-specific cost ratios.
