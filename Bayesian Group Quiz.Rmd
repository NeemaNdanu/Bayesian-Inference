## QUESTION 1

Concentrations of the pollutants aldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in
nanograms per liter were measured in ten surface water samples, ten
mid-depth water samples, and tePn bottom samples from the Wolf River in
Tennessee. The samples were taken downstream from an abandoned dump site
previously used by the pesticide industry. The full data set can be
found at <http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~lynn/iid/wolf.river.dat>. For this
problem, we consider only HCB measurements taken at the bottom and the
surface. The question of interest is whether the distribution of HCB
concentration depends on the depth at which the measurement was taken.
The data for this problem are given below.

Surface Bottom 3.74 5.44 4.61 6.88 4.00 5.37 4.67 5.44 4.87 5.03 5.12
6.48 4.52 3.89 5.29 5.85 5.74 6.85 5.48 7.16

Assume the observations are independent normal random variables with
unknown depth-specific means Qs and Qb and precisions Rs and Rb. Assume
independent improper reference priors for the surface and bottom
parameters:

```         
 g(𝜃s,𝜃b ,𝜌sand 𝜌b )    =   𝑔(𝜃s,𝜌b)    𝑔(𝜃 s,𝜌b ) ∝    𝜌s 𝜌b   
 
```

This prior can be treated as the product of two normal-gamma priors with
µs = µb = 0, ks = kb =0, as = ab = -1/2, and bs = bb = ∞. (These are not
valid normal-gamma distributions, but you can use the usual Bayesian
conjugate updating rule to find the posterior distribution.)

```{r}
# Data for HCB concentrations
surface <- c(3.74, 4.61, 4.00, 4.67, 4.87, 5.12, 4.52, 5.29, 5.74, 5.48)
bottom <- c(5.44, 6.88, 5.37, 5.44, 5.03, 6.48, 3.89, 5.85, 6.85, 7.16)

# Compute sample statistics
n_surface <- length(surface)
n_bottom <- length(bottom)

# Compute mean and variance
mean_surface <- mean(surface)
var_surface <- var(surface)
sd_surface <- sqrt(var_surface)  # Standard deviation
precision_surface <- 1 / var_surface  # Precision is the inverse of variance

mean_bottom <- mean(bottom)
var_bottom <- var(bottom)
sd_bottom <- sqrt(var_bottom)  # Standard deviation
precision_bottom <- 1 / var_bottom  # Precision is the inverse of variance

# Print results
cat("Surface Mean:", mean_surface, "\n")
cat("Surface Variance:", var_surface, "\n")
cat("Surface Standard Deviation:", sd_surface, "\n")
cat("Surface Precision:", precision_surface, "\n\n")

cat("Bottom Mean:", mean_bottom, "\n")
cat("Bottom Variance:", var_bottom, "\n")
cat("Bottom Standard Deviation:", sd_bottom, "\n")
cat("Bottom Precision:", precision_bottom, "\n")
```

The average HCB concentration is higher at the bottom than at the
surface, but the bottom also shows greater variability, as indicated by
its higher variance and standard deviation. This means HCB
concentrations at the bottom are more spread out, while surface
concentrations are more consistent. The higher precision at the surface
further confirms this consistency. These differences may be influenced
by environmental factors such as sedimentation or diffusion effects.

### Find the joint posterior distribution for the parameters (𝜃,𝜃 ,𝜌,𝜌 ).

```{r}
# Prior hyperparameters (Improper prior)
mu_0_surface <- 0  # Prior mean for surface
mu_0_bottom <- 0   # Prior mean for bottom
k_0 <- 0           # Prior precision multipliers

alpha_0 <- -0.5    # Shape parameter for the Gamma prior (improper)
beta_0 <- Inf      # Scale parameter (infinite for improper prior)

# Posterior parameters for surface
k_surface <- k_0 + n_surface
post_mu_surface <- (k_0 * mu_0_surface + n_surface * mean_surface) / k_surface
post_alpha_surface <- alpha_0 + n_surface / 2
post_beta_surface <- sum((surface - mean_surface)^2) / 2

# Posterior parameters for bottom
k_bottom <- k_0 + n_bottom
post_mu_bottom <- (k_0 * mu_0_bottom + n_bottom * mean_bottom) / k_bottom
post_alpha_bottom <- alpha_0 + n_bottom / 2
post_beta_bottom <- sum((bottom - mean_bottom)^2) / 2

# Print results
cat("Surface:\n")
cat("Posterior precision multiplier:", k_surface, "\n")
cat("Posterior Mean:", post_mu_surface, "\n")
cat("Posterior alpha:", post_alpha_surface, "\n")
cat("Posterior beta:", post_beta_surface, "\n\n")

cat("Bottom:\n")
cat("Posterior precision multiplier:", k_bottom, "\n")
cat("Posterior Mean:", post_mu_bottom, "\n")
cat("Posterior alpha:", post_alpha_bottom, "\n")
cat("Posterior beta:", post_beta_bottom, "\n")
```

The results indicate that the posterior mean at the bottom is higher
than at the surface, and the larger posterior beta for the bottom
suggests greater uncertainty or variability in concentration levels at
that depth.

### State the type of distribution and the posterior hyperparameters.

The posterior distribution follows a Normal-Gamma distribution, where
the mean ($\theta$) given the precision ($\rho$) follows a Normal
distribution, and the precision ($\rho$) follows a Gamma distribution.

The posterior hyperparameters include the

1.  Posterior mean ($\mu_n$), which is a weighted average of the prior
    mean and sample mean,
2.  Posterior precision multiplier ($k_n$), which accounts for sample
    size,
3.  Posterior shape parameter ($\alpha_n$), which increases with the
    number of observations, and
4.  Posterior scale parameter ($\beta_n$), which reflects the sum of
    squared deviations from the mean.

These parameters determine the updated beliefs about the HCB
concentration at different depths.

### Find 90% posterior credible intervals for 𝜃s,𝜃b ,𝜌sand 𝜌b .

```{r}
# Load necessary package
library(extraDistr)

# Compute CI for Precision:
# Compute 90% credible intervals for precision ρ (inverse variance)
ci_rho_surface <- qgamma(c(0.05, 0.95), shape = post_alpha_surface, scale = 1 / post_beta_surface)
ci_rho_bottom <- qgamma(c(0.05, 0.95), shape = post_alpha_bottom, scale = 1 / post_beta_bottom)

# Compute CI for Mean:
# Compute standard deviation for the posterior mean
s_surface <- 1 / sqrt(k_surface * post_alpha_surface * post_beta_surface)
s_bottom <- 1 / sqrt(k_bottom * post_alpha_bottom * post_beta_bottom)

# Degrees of freedom for t-distribution
df_surface <- 2 * post_alpha_surface
df_bottom <- 2 * post_alpha_bottom

# t-quantiles for 90% credible interval (5% in each tail)
t_quantile_s <- qt(0.95, df_surface)  
t_quantile_b <- qt(0.95, df_bottom)  

# Compute 90% credible intervals for mean θ
ci_mean_surface <- c(post_mu_surface - t_quantile_s * s_surface, post_mu_surface + t_quantile_s * s_surface)
ci_mean_bottom <- c(post_mu_bottom - t_quantile_b * s_bottom, post_mu_bottom + t_quantile_b * s_bottom)

# Print results
cat("90% Posterior Credible Intervals:\n")
cat("Mean of Surface:", ci_mean_surface, "\n")
cat("Mean of Bottom:", ci_mean_bottom, "\n")
cat("Precision of Surface:", ci_rho_surface, "\n")
cat("Precision of Bottom:", ci_rho_bottom, "\n")
```

The 90% posterior credible intervals provide a range of values where the
true parameters are likely to fall. The credible interval for the mean
($\theta_s, \theta_b$) is derived using a t-distribution, accounting for
uncertainty in the mean estimate, while the credible interval for
precision ($\rho_s, \rho_b$) follows a Gamma distribution, reflecting
uncertainty in variance.

The results indicate that the mean HCB concentration at the bottom is
higher than at the surface, and the wider credible interval for bottom
precision suggests greater variability in concentration estimates at
that depth.

### Comment on your results.

The results indicate that

1.  HCB concentrations are higher at the bottom than at the surface, but
    they also exhibit greater variability, as reflected in the wider
    credible intervals for precision.

2.  Surface concentrations are more consistent, supported by the
    narrower credible intervals and higher precision.

3.  Posterior Normal-Gamma distribution effectively captures this
    uncertainty, with the mean following Normal distribution and
    precision following a Gamma distribution.

4.  Larger posterior beta for the bottom suggests higher uncertainty in
    concentration estimates at that depth.These differences may be
    driven by environmental factors such as sedimentation and diffusion,
    which influence HCB distribution in deeper waters.

## QUESTION 2

Use direct Monte Carlo to sample 10,000 observations from the joint
posterior distribution of (𝜃s,𝜃b ,𝜌sand 𝜌b ).

### Use your Monte Carlo samples to estimate 90% posterior credible intervals for𝜃s,𝜃b ,𝜌sand 𝜌b .

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of Monte Carlo samples
samples_size <- 10000

# Monte Carlo Sampling from Posterior
rho_surface <- rgamma(samples_size, shape = post_alpha_surface, scale = 1 / post_beta_surface)
mean_surface_samples <- rnorm(samples_size, mean = post_mu_surface, sd = 1 / sqrt(k_surface * rho_surface))

rho_bottom <- rgamma(samples_size, shape = post_alpha_bottom, scale = 1 / post_beta_bottom)
mean_bottom_samples <- rnorm(samples_size, mean = post_mu_bottom, sd = 1 / sqrt(k_bottom * rho_bottom))

# Compute 90% posterior credible intervals
ci_theta_s <- quantile(mean_surface_samples, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))
ci_theta_b <- quantile(mean_bottom_samples, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))
ci_rho_s <- quantile(rho_surface, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))
ci_rho_b <- quantile(rho_bottom, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))

# Print results
cat("90% Monte Carlo Posterior Credible Intervals:\n")
cat("Mean of Surface (Theta_s):", ci_theta_s, "\n")
cat("Mean of Bottom (Theta_b):", ci_theta_b, "\n")
cat("Precision of Surface (Rho_s):", ci_rho_s, "\n")
cat("Precision of Bottom (Rho_b):", ci_rho_b, "\n")
```

The Monte Carlo method provides a numerical approximation of the
posterior distributions, which is useful when analytical solutions are
complex.

The interval for θ s (surface mean) [4.431, 5.166] and for θ b (bottom
mean) [5.264, 6.436] show that HCB concentration at the bottom is
generally higher than at the surface.

The precision intervals indicate that surface concentrations are more
consistent (less variable) than those at the bottom.

The Monte Carlo estimates align well with the previous analytical
results, reinforcing that the posterior means and precisions are well
captured by the Normal-Gamma structure.

### Compare with the result of Problem 1.

```{r}
# Theoretical marginal density for theta
mean_vals <- seq(min(mean_surface_samples, mean_bottom_samples) - 0.5, max(mean_surface_samples, mean_bottom_samples) + 0.5, length.out = 100)

# Compute the theoretical density
# For surface:
std_vals_s <- (mean_vals - post_mu_surface) / s_surface
thetaMargDens_s <- dt(std_vals_s, df = 2 * post_alpha_surface) / s_surface

# For bottom:
std_vals_b <- (mean_vals - post_mu_bottom) / s_bottom
thetaMargDens_b <- dt(std_vals_b, df = 2 * post_alpha_bottom) / s_bottom

# Determine an appropriate y-axis range
y_max_s <- max(density(mean_surface_samples)$y, thetaMargDens_s)
y_max_b <- max(density(mean_bottom_samples)$y, thetaMargDens_b)

# Plot comparison for surface
plot(density(mean_surface_samples), col = "blue", lty = 2, 
     main = "Surface: Theoretical vs Monte Carlo Posterior Densities", 
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Density", 
     xlim = range(mean_vals), ylim = c(0, y_max_s * 1.1))  
lines(mean_vals, thetaMargDens_s, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("Monte Carlo Surface", "Theoretical Surface"), 
       col = c("blue", "red"), lty = c(2, 1), lwd = c(1, 2))

# Plot comparison for bottom
plot(density(mean_bottom_samples), col = "green", lty = 2, 
     main = "Bottom: Theoretical vs Monte Carlo Posterior Densities", 
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Density", 
     xlim = range(mean_vals), ylim = c(0, y_max_b * 1.1)) 
lines(mean_vals, thetaMargDens_b, col = "purple", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("Monte Carlo Bottom", "Theoretical Bottom"), 
       col = c("green", "purple"), lty = c(2, 1), lwd = c(1, 2))

```

For the first plot(Surface) we got the following observation: 1. The
Monte Carlo estimate roughly follows the theoretical distribution but is
slightly more spread out.

2.  The theoretical posterior has a narrower peak, meaning that it
    suggests lower uncertainty about θ at the surface compared to the
    Monte Carlo estimate.

For the second plot(Bottom) we got the following observation: 1. The
Monte Carlo estimate is significantly wider and flatter than the
theoretical posterior.

2.  The theoretical posterior density has a very sharp peak, indicating
    a strong concentration of probability around a specific value of θ.

The discrepancy is larger compared to the surface plot, suggesting that
at the bottom level, the Monte Carlo sampling introduces more
variability or is not as precise.

In summary : 1. The theoretical posterior is narrower in both cases,
indicating a more confident estimation of θ.

2.  The Monte Carlo estimate is closer to the theoretical at the surface
    but diverges more at the bottom, suggesting that the estimation of θ
    is less precise at greater depths.

3.  The bottom level shows greater variation in Monte Carlo sampling,
    possibly due to fewer observations or higher uncertainty in the
    data.

### Comparison of kernel density estimate based on the smaple size direct MC draws, theoretical t density, and normal density using sample standard deviation

```{r}
# Define a range of values for theta (mean)
mean_vals <- seq(min(mean_surface_samples) - 0.5, max(mean_surface_samples) + 0.5, length.out = 100)
mean_vals <- seq(min(mean_bottom_samples) - 0.5, max(mean_bottom_samples) + 0.5, length.out = 100)

# Kernel density estimate (KDE) from MC samples
kde_surface <- density(mean_surface_samples)
kde_bottom <- density(mean_bottom_samples)


# Theoretical t-density
std_vals_s <- (mean_vals - post_mu_surface) / s_surface
thetaMargDens_s <- dt(std_vals_s, df = 2 * post_alpha_surface) / s_surface

std_vals_b <- (mean_vals - post_mu_bottom) / s_bottom
thetaMargDens_b <- dt(std_vals_b, df = 2 * post_alpha_bottom) / s_bottom

# Normal density using sample mean and standard deviation
normal_dens_s <- dnorm(mean_vals, mean = mean_surface, sd = sd_surface)
normal_dens_b <- dnorm(mean_vals, mean = mean_bottom, sd = sd_bottom)

# Plot comparison for surface
plot(kde_surface, col = "blue", lty = 2, main = "Surface: KDE vs Theoretical t vs Normal Density", 
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Density", xlim = range(mean_vals), ylim = c(0, max(c(kde_surface$y, thetaMargDens_s, normal_dens_s))))
lines(mean_vals, thetaMargDens_s, col = "red", lwd = 2)
lines(mean_vals, normal_dens_s, col = "green", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("KDE (MC)", "Theoretical t", "Normal Density"), 
       col = c("blue", "red", "green"), lty = c(2, 1, 1), lwd = c(1, 2, 2))

# Plot comparison for bottom
plot(kde_bottom, col = "blue", lty = 2, main = "Bottom: KDE vs Theoretical t vs Normal Density", 
     xlab = expression(theta), ylab = "Density", xlim = range(mean_vals), ylim = c(0, max(c(kde_bottom$y, thetaMargDens_b, normal_dens_b))))
lines(mean_vals, thetaMargDens_b, col = "red", lwd = 2)
lines(mean_vals, normal_dens_b, col = "green", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("KDE (MC)", "Theoretical t", "Normal Density"), 
       col = c("blue", "red", "green"), lty = c(2, 1, 1), lwd = c(1, 2, 2))
```

The following are the key observation made in terms of: 1. Shape
Differences Across Methods:

-   The theoretical t-distribution (red line) is sharply peaked and has
    heavier tails.

-   The KDE (blue line) provides an empirical estimate based on MC
    samples and is slightly smoother.

-   The normal density (green line) is more spread out and does not
    capture heavy tails.

    2.  Comparison of the Two Plots:

-   In the surface plot, the density curves are more spread out,
    indicating more variation in the sample.

-   In the bottom plot, the theoretical t-density is more peaked,
    suggesting that the bottom samples are more concentrated around
    their mean.

    3.  Monte Carlo Approximation:

-   The KDE (blue) closely follows the theoretical t-distribution but is
    smoother due to the sample-based nature of KDE.

-   The normal density (green) deviates more, especially in the peak and
    tails, confirming that normality may not be the best assumption.

In conclusion: - The theoretical t-distribution captures the shape of
the parameter uncertainty better than the normal approximation.

-   KDE provides an empirical estimate that aligns closely with the
    theoretical t-density.

-   The surface dataset exhibits slightly more spread, while the bottom
    dataset is more concentrated around its mean.

## QUESTION 3

### Use your direct Monte Carlo sample to estimate the probability that the mean bottom concentration 𝜃b is higher than the mean surface concentration 𝜃s and estimate the probability that the standard deviation 𝜎b of the bottom concentrations is higher than the standard deviation 𝜎 sof the surface concentrations.

```{r}
# Probability that theta_b > theta_s
prob_theta_b_gt_theta_s <- mean(mean_bottom_samples > mean_surface_samples)
cat("Probability that mean of bottom > mean of surface:", prob_theta_b_gt_theta_s, "\n")

# Probability that sigma_b > sigma_s
sigma_surface_samples <- 1 / sqrt(rho_surface)
sigma_bottom_samples <- 1 / sqrt(rho_bottom)

prob_sigma_b_gt_sigma_s <- mean(sigma_bottom_samples > sigma_surface_samples)
cat("Probability that standard deviation of bottom > standard deviation of surface:", prob_sigma_b_gt_sigma_s, "\n")
```

The probability that mean of bottom \> mean of surface is very high
(99.07%), indicating that in almost all Monte Carlo (MC) simulations,
the bottom mean concentration is greater than the surface mean
concentration.

This suggests that the bottom environment tends to have consistently
higher concentration levels than the surface.

The probability that standard deviation of bottom \> standard deviation
of surface: is 91.38%, meaning that in most cases, the bottom
concentrations exhibit greater variability than surface concentrations.

This suggests that conditions at the bottom lead to more fluctuations in
concentration levels compared to the surface.

### Quetsion 4

### Comment on your analysis. What are your conclusions about the distributions of surface and bottom concentrations? Is the assumption of normality reasonable? Are the means different for surface and bottom? The standard deviations?

```{r}
# Q-Q Plots
qqnorm(surface, main = "Q-Q Plot for Surface Concentrations")
qqline(surface, col = "red")

qqnorm(bottom, main = "Q-Q Plot for Bottom Concentrations")
qqline(bottom, col = "blue")
```

The Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plots visually assess the normality of the
Bottom Concentrations and Surface Concentrations data. If the Q-Q plot
shows points deviating significantly from the reference line, it
suggests non-normality.

Based on the Q-Q Plots of the: 1. Surface Concentrations: - The points
are fairly close to the straight red line, though minor deviations
exist.The data appears to follow a normal distribution reasonably well.

```         
2. Bottom Concentrations:
```

-   The points mostly align with the straight blue line but show some
    deviations at the tails (lower left and upper right).This suggests
    that while the data is approximately normal, there may be slight
    skewness or outliers.

Hence both distributions show approximate normality, but with minor
deviations at the tails.

Based on the Comparison of Means and Standard Deviations: 1. The means
for surface and bottom are significantly different, implying that depth
influences the concentration levels.

```         
2. The standard deviations are also different, further supporting that bottom concentrations are more dispersed
than surface concentrations.
```

Based on the analysis of the distributions of surface and bottom
concentrations, we draw the following conclusions: 1. In term of Mean
Concentrations: - The mean HCB concentration at the bottom is higher
than at the surface, suggesting that contaminants tend to accumulate
more in deeper waters.This may be due to sedimentation and reduced
mixing at greater depths.

```         
2. In terms of variability in Concentrations:
```

-The bottom concentrations exhibit greater variance and standard
deviation, indicating higher variability in concentration levels at that
depth. In contrast, surface concentrations are more consistent, with a
lower variance and higher precision.

### 1. **Predictive Distribution (Surface):** 

-   **Histogram :** The histogram represents the density of predicted
    HCB concentrations at the surface level. Most of the predictions
    fall within the range of 4.5 to 5.5 units of HCB concentration.

-   **Density Curve (red line):** The red line overlaid on the histogram
    represents a fitted probability density function . The shape is
    unimodal and slightly skewed to the right, with a peak around 5.0
    units.

-   **Skewness:** The tail on the right-hand side suggests the
    distribution is slightly skewed right, indicating there are a few
    predictions with higher-than-average HCB concentrations, but most
    predictions cluster around 5.0.

### 2. **Predictive Distribution (Bottom):**

-   **Histogram :** This histogram represents the density of predicted
    HCB concentrations at the bottom level. The data is more spread out
    than the surface predictions, ranging from approximately 5.0 to 7.0
    units.

-   **Density Curve (red line):** The density curve indicates a peak
    around 6.0 units, but the distribution is also slightly skewed
    right. The peak is more pronounced compared to the surface plot,
    suggesting that higher HCB concentrations are more frequent at the
    bottom.

-   **Skewness:** Similar to the surface plot, there’s a right skew,
    indicating that while most predictions hover around 6.0, there are
    some higher concentrations.

### **General Observations:**

-   The surface predictions show lower concentrations of HCB, centered
    around 5.0 units, while the bottom predictions are higher, centered
    around 6.0 units.

-   The difference in concentration levels suggests that HCB may
    accumulate more at the bottom than at the surface.

-   Both distributions have a slight right skew, indicating that while
    most predictions are close to the center, some higher concentrations
    are possible.

### **Interpratation:**

-   **Monte Carlo (Blue for Surface, Green for Bottom)**:

```         
-   **Narrowest distribution** with tightly concentrated values.

-   Peaks at **5.0** for surface and **6.0** for bottom, indicating
    less variability.

-   Reflects **more certainty** and a **constrained range** of
    concentrations, with fewer extreme values.
```

```         

-   **Prediction (Cyan for Surface, Orange for Bottom)**:
```

-   **Moderate distribution** that balances between Monte Carlo’s narro
    focus and the broader theoretical range.

-   Peaks at the same values as Monte Carlo (**5.0** for surface and
    **6.0** for bottom) but allows for slightly more spread, reflecting
    **some variability**.

-   Acts as a middle ground, acknowledging variability without going to
    theoretical extremes. \`\`\`

-   **Key Takeaways**:

    **Monte Carlo** shows the most **certainty** with concentrated
    predictions.

    **Prediction** finds a **balance** between certainty (Monte Carlo)
    and uncertainty (Theoretical), offering a realistic compromise.

This comparison applies consistently across both the **surface** and
**bottom** layers, with the bottom layer having higher concentration
peaks overall.
